# Brain-Inspired-AI

Jupyter Notebook** for **_Brain Inspired Artificial Intelligent_** Course. Objective of the course is to understand the core ideas behind **_brain-inspired learning algorithms_** for **_supervised learning, auto-associative memories, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning_**, with focus on their use in **_AI_** and how they related to **_neuroscience knowledge_**.

## Boltzmann Machine.ipynb & Boltzmann_Machine_Theory.pdf

Programmed a **_Boltzmann Machine_** from scratch, a **_Boltzmann Machine_** is a **_stochastic recurrent neural network_** for **_unsupervised learning_** they can be seen as the **_stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield networks._** They were one of the first neural networks capable of learning **_internal representations_**(...**_unsupervised learning_**...) and are able to represent and (given sufficient time) solve combinatoric problems. **_Theory_** for the implementation is available on the **_Boltzmann_Machine_Theory.pdf_** file. I have trained my own implementations of a Boltzmann Machine using **_MNIST Dataset_**
